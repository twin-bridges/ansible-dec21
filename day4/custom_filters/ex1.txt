Create a filter plugin that processes the "show ip arp" output from the Arista 
switches. The filter plugin should take the ARP output as a string and return the 
list of MAC addresses that are present in the ARP output.

Construct an Ansible playbook that retrieves "show ip arp" from all of the Arista 
switches. 

Process this ARP output through the new filter and verify that the list of MAC 
addresses is being properly returned.
