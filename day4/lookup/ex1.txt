Create a custom Ansible inventory for the Arista devices that does NOT contain 
either the ansible_user or the ansible_ssh_pass.

Create an Ansible playbook. 

In this playbook, create variables for both 'ansible_ssh_pass' and for 'ansible_user'.

The 'ansible_ssh_pass' variable should be set using a "lookup" and the 
ANSIBLE_PASSWORD environment variable (this environment variable should already 
be set in the lab environment). 

In other words, you should not hard-code the password in the playbook; instead 
you should be reading it from the referenced environment variable.

Your playbook should successfully execute the "show vlan" command on all of the 
remote Arista devices using the eos_command module (use the "-i new_inventory_file.ini" 
to use the new inventory file you created). 

Print the returned output from "show vlan" to the screen to verify the playbook 
executed correctly.
