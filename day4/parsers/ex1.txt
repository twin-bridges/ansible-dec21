1a. Using genie and the "clay584.genie" collection execute "show interface" on the 
two NX-OS switches. Use the "parse_genie" filter to convert this output to 
structured data.

Print the returned data structure to standard out using "debug" and verify that 
this data structure is in fact structured data (instead of a string).


1b. Repeat the same pattern as exercise1a except this time execute 
"show version". 

From this output extract the software version and print it to the screen.
