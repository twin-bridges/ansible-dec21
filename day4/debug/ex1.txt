Exercise1 contains a set of playbooks (exercise1a.yml through exercise7g.yml).

Each of these playbooks will fail (i.e. not execute properly). 

You should "git clone" or "git rebase" this repository to your lab environment 
(or otherwise copy the six playbooks; you will also need to copy any of the TextFSM 
templates located in that exercise6 directory).

Your job for each of these playbooks is to find and correct the error in each playbook.

In general, the playbook should only contain one error. Note, the error may or 
may not result in an actual Ansible execution failure (i.e. ansible-playbook detecting 
the task as failed and stopping execution). Or worded differently, a couple of 
the playbooks execute successfully from an Ansible perspective, but do not do what 
they are supposed to do.

You should try to fix each one of these playbooks on your own.

For reference, there is also a solutions directory where I have created a "fixed" 
version of each playbook. You can do a diff between the failing and fixed playbook 
to see the exact issue (but once again try to solve them yourself).
