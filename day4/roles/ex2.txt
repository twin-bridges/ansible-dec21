Create an Ansible role that configures VRF-lite on the cisco5 and cisco6 devices 
(see the reference configuration below). This same configuration should be deployed 
to both routers. 

You should make variables out of the VRF names, route distinguishers, and 
VRF-interfaces (i.e. the interface a given VRF is assigned to). 

All the elements used to accomplish this configuration should be included in the 
role (tasks, variables, templates).
