Create an Ansible role that configures NTP on the IOS, IOS-XE, Arista, and NX-OS 
devices. 

The Ansible role should use "ios_config", "eos_config", and "nxos_config" to accomplish this. 

In each case, an external Jinja2 template should be used (in other words, the 
"src" argument to ios_config/eos_config/nxos_config should be used). 

All of the configuration tasks for this role should be located in "tasks/main.yml". 

All of the variables and Jinja2 templates should be included in the role.
