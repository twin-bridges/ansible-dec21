[Optional - requires Python] 

Expand the dynamic inventory script located here:

https://github.com/twin-bridges/ansible-dec21/blob/main/dynamic_inventory/dyn_inv.py

Such that all the devices located in Ansible inventory (~/ansible-hosts.ini) are 
included in the dynamic inventory script. 

You should just hard code the device definitions inside the script such that they 
get outputted properly as JSON (i.e. hard-code them in the script using Python 
data structures).

Ensure your script works properly when executed as follows:

$ ./your_inv_script.py --list


And:

$ ./your_inv_script.py --host nxos1

Where "nxos1" is some host in inventory.

In a real dynamic inventory scenario, you would be pulling the device and group 
information from external systems via APIs; converting to the proper data 
structure(s), and then outputting these data structures in JSON. 

Consequently, in this exercise, we are only really doing the last part of this
(the proper output in JSON format so Ansible can ingest the inventory information).

When your script is done, the output of the below ansible-inventory command should
look as follows:

$ ansible-inventory --graph -i ./dyn_inv.py 
@all:
  |--@arista:
  |  |--arista5
  |  |--arista6
  |  |--arista7
  |  |--arista8
  |--@cisco:
  |  |--cisco1
  |  |--cisco2
  |  |--cisco5

  |  |--vmx1
