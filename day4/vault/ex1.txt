Create a new directory for exercise1 and in this directory create the following 
sub-directories and files:

$ cat ./group_vars/arista/dns.yml
---
domain_name: bogus.com
dns_server1: 8.8.8.8
dns_server2: 8.8.4.4

$ cat ./group_vars/arista/ntp.yml
---
ntp_server1: 130.126.24.24
ntp_server2: 152.2.21.1

Also create the following playbook:

---
- name: Exercise1
  hosts: arista
  gather_facts: False
  tasks:
    - debug:
        var: ntp_server1

    - debug:
        var: domain_name

Verify your playbook executes properly and the two specified variables from 
group_vars are printed out to standard output.
 

a. Using 'ansible-vault encrypt', encrypt the two YAML files in group_vars. 

Verify the two files are in fact encrypted by looking at the files. Verify your 
playbook still executes properly when using the '--ask-vault-pass' command-line 
argument.


b. Create a file named ".my_vault" in the same directory as your playbook. Store 
your vault password in this file. Using this file and the "--vault-password-file .my_vault" 
command-line argument, verify your playbook still executes properly.


c. Use 'ansible-vault view' to view the dns.yml file. You should be able to see 
the clear-text contents of this file.


d. Configure the following in your ~/.ansible.cfg file:

vault_password_file = /path/to/.my_vault

After making this change, verify your playbook still executes properly, but without 
you needing to specify any additional command-line arguments.


e. Execute 'ansible-vault decrypt' to decrypt both the dns.yml and the ntp.yml 
files. Verify these files are now both clear-text YAML files.
