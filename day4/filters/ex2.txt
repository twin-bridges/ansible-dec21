Create a filter plugin that processes the "show ip arp" output from the four 
Cisco IOS/IOS-XE routers. The filter plugin should take the ARP output as a string 
and return a dictionary where the key is the IP address and the value is the MAC 
address.

Construct an Ansible playbook that retrieves "show ip arp" from the four Cisco 
IOS/IOS-XE routers. 

Process this ARP output through the new filter and verify that the new dictionary 
is properly returned for each device.
