All of theses exercises require the following Python script:
------------------------------------------------------------

https://github.com/twin-bridges/ansible-dec21/blob/main/day1/yaml/print_yaml.py

To run this python script you can 'git clone' this repository, or just copy/paste
the contents of the script into a ".py" file on your system. Use the following 
command to run the script:

$ python print_yaml.py

Verify each of these exercises by running the above script and by providing your
YAML filename (the script will prompt you).



1a. Create a YAML file that is a five element list (in expanded YAML format).


1b. Create a YAML file that is a five element list, but in a compressed YAML
format. Once again, use the "print_yaml.py" python script to print the contents
of the YAML file to stdout.

1c. Create a YAML file that contains a dictionary representing a networking
device (in an expanded YAML format). The highest level key should be the device
name (for example, "rtr1"). The value corresponding to that key should be another
dictionary. This inner dictionary should have the following key-value pairs
(host, username, password, device_type, use_session_log). use_session_log should
be a YAML-boolean, the rest of the values should be strings. 


1d. Duplicate the dictionary created in the previous task except this time use 
the compressed YAML format. Once again, print the contents of the file using 
print_yaml.py. The result should match the result of exercise 1c.


1e. Create a YAML file that is a nested data structure. The highest level data 
structure should be a dictionary with a key-name of "network_devices". The value 
corresponding to this key should be a two-element list. Each element of this list 
should contain a dictionary with six key-value pairs (host, username, password, 
device_type, use_session_log, ip_addresses). The ip_addresses key should point 
to a list of IP addresses that each network device contains (just make up three 
IP addresses for each device).
