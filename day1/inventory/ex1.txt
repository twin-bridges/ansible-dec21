Create an "INI" style inventory file. This file should have an "all:vars" 
section containing variables for the following:

  * ansible_connection type should be set to "network_cli"
  * ansible_python_interpreter should be set to "~/VENV/py3_venv/bin/python"
  * ansible_user should be set to the course's standard value
  * ansible_ssh_pass should be set to the string "invalid"

Additionally, add the following three groups to the inventory file:

  * local
  * cisco
  * arista

Use the ansible-inventory --list -i ./inventory.ini to validate and inspect your 
inventory file, your output should look similar to the following:

{
    "_meta": {
        "hostvars": {}
    },
    "all": {
        "children": [
            "arista",
            "cisco",
            "local",
            "ungrouped"
        ]
    }
}
