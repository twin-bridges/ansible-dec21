Create a directory called "group_vars" in the same directory as your playbook. 
Within this directory, create a file named "all.yml". 

In this file, define a variable named "desired_eos_version" and set it to a value 
of "4.18.3". 

Create a playbook that executes on the Arista5 host. This playbook should have a
single task which uses the "ansible.builtin.debug" module and prints out the
"desired_eos_version" variable.

Add a task to your playbook to create a new variable using "ansible.builtin.set_fact". 
Name this variable "device_hostname" and set the value of it equal to the 
"inventory_hostname" combined with the suffix ".lab.io". 

In a final task, print the value of this variable using debug.
