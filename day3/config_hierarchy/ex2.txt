Repeat exercise1, except one of the last three access-list lines is now at the 
beginning. 

Additionally convert this moved ACL entry from being a "permit" statement to being 
a "deny" statement. 

Ensure that executing your new playbook results in the correct final access-list 
being configured. For example, my new access-list would look as follows:

ip access-list extended TEST-ANSIBLEX
 deny   ip host 10.1.1.9 any
 permit ip host 10.1.1.1 any
 permit ip host 10.1.1.2 any
 permit ip host 10.1.1.3 any
 permit ip host 10.1.1.4 any
 permit ip host 10.1.1.5 any
 permit ip host 10.1.1.6 any
 permit ip host 10.1.1.7 any
 permit ip host 10.1.1.8 any
 permit ip host 10.1.1.10 any

Once again use the "ios_command" module and the "debug" module to verify that 
your updated ACL is properly configured.

Your playbook should be idempotent.
