Repeat exercise1 except now use the "cli_config" module for all of the devices 
(instead of ios_config, eos_config, nxos_config, and junos_config). Once again 
your final playbook should be idempotent.

If possible, attempt to do the configuration for all ten devices using a single
play that contains a single task.

Note, "cli_config" does not support the "src" argument, but you can still 
generate configurations from a template using a "lookup" with the following
syntax.

    - name: Configure device from external template
      ansible.netcommon.cli_config:
        config: "{{ lookup('template', 'my_config.j2') }}"


Note, I had to explicitly set the following at the task level for the Juniper devices

      vars:
          # cli_config requires network_cli (Juniper defaults to netconf in inventory)
          ansible_connection: network_cli
