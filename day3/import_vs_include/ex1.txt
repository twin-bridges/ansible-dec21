1a. Create a playbook that runs against localhost. In this playbook, create a task 
that uses "include_tasks" and loads in an external sub-tasks file named 
"subtask1.yml". 

The task in the main playbook should have a loop that loops over four IP 
addresses. The sub-tasks file should have a "debug" task that prints out the 
IP address.


1b. Add the name of your sub-tasks file into "host_vars/localhost.yml". Convert 
your "include_tasks" statement in your main playbook to use the variable defined 
in host_vars. The rest of the task and sub-task should remain the same (i.e. 
looping over four IP addresses and printing them out).


1c. Create a file named "subtask2.yml" that has three "debug" tasks. These debug 
tasks should each print out slightly different messages. Additionally, these 
three sub-tasks should each have their own "tag" associated with them. 

Create a new main playbook that uses "include_tasks" to execute the tasks in 
"subtask2.yml". 

No loop is necessary in this exercise. 

What happens if you execute your playbook and pass in one of the "tags" defined 
in "subtask2.yml". Does the sub-task actually execute? Why not? At this point, 
it is assumed that the main playbook has no tags defined in it.

While still using "include_tasks", how could you correct the main playbook such 
that the proper sub-task would execute if you use the sub-tasks corresponding 
"tag"?
