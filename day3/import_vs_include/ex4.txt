4. Construct a playbook that executes against the Arista, Cisco IOS/IOS-XE, 
and Cisco NX-OS lab devices. 

The playbook should consist of a single Ansible play.

The tasks for each platform should configure the global parameters (DNS servers, 
NTP servers, and domain-name). The actual configuration tasks for each platform 
should be imported/included from an external task file per platform.

You should make a distinction between Cisco IOS and IOS-XE since there are slight 
syntactical differences for their DNS configurations. 

Your top level playbook should also have tags corresponding to "ios", "ios-xe", 
"eos", and "nxos" such that you could execute your playbook with that tag and 
only configure that platform.

Make sure your playbook works properly with no tags (i.e. all of the platforms 
are configured).

Make sure your playbook works properly using tags (i.e. only that platform is 
configured).
