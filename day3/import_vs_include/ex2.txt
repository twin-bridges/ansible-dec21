2a. Convert exercise1a over to use "import_tasks" instead of "include_tasks".
Where do you need to relocate the loop for proper execution?


2b. Try to convert exercise1b over to "import_tasks" instead of "include_tasks" 
while using a variable from inventory. Will you be able to do this? Why not? 
How could you use a variable for the file name while still using "import_tasks"? 

Hint, what are some other variable locations besides inventory where you could 
define the sub-tasks file name?


2c. Convert exercise1c over to use "import_tasks" instead of "include_tasks". If 
no tags are defined in the main playbook (i.e. on the "import_tasks" task), then 
what happens upon ansible-playbook execution (in other words, you pass in a "tag" 
via ansible-playbook and that tag only exists in the sub-task file)? 

Does the sub-task execute or not? Why does the sub-task execute?
