Using the configurations generated from:

  {{ github_repo }}/day2/jinja2/ex2.txt

Configure both BGP and the relevant interface on both nxos1 and nxos2.

In other words, Jinja2 exercise2 was an exercise where we used Jinja2 to generate 
both BGP and interface configurations for nxos1 and nxos2, BUT we did not deploy 
those configurations. Now you should use the nxos_config module to deploy those 
configurations.

Verify the BGP session reached the established using the nxos_command module. 

For this verification task, you can simply execute "show ip bgp summary" using 
nxos_command and visually verify its output using the "debug" module.
