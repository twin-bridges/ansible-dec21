Using a single Jina2 template and an Ansible Playbook generate a configuration 
matching the following for each of the four Arista switches:

https://github.com/twin-bridges/ansible-dec21/blob/main/day2/jinja2/CFGS/arista5.txt

The four Arista switch configurations should be identical to each other except 
the hostname and the VLAN1 IP address will change. 

Your output filenames should be stored in a separate directory and should be 
named "{{ inventory_hostname }}.txt" (for example, ./CFGS/arista5.txt).

The Jinja2 template should have variables for the following:
hostname          # pull from inventory_hostname
ntp_server1       # set in group_vars/all.yml
timezone          # set in group_vars/all.yml
vlan1_ip_address  # set in host_vars/aristaX.yml (see table)
vlan1_netmask     # set in host_vars/aristaX.yml (always "24")
def_gateway       # group_vars/arista.yml (always 10.220.88.1)

For the "Ethernet" interfaces section, you should use a Jinja2 for-loop in your template.

Additionally, each of the interfaces should be configured with the proper VLAN 
(see the above arista5.txt configuration for details). 

This VLAN information should be stored in group_vars/arista.yml in some way (your 
data structure will need to create a binding in some way between the interface 
name and the VLAN assignment).

Table of IP addresses:
-----------------------
arista5       10.220.88.32/24
arista6       10.220.88.33/24
arista7       10.220.88.34/24
arista8       10.220.88.35/24

These generated configurations when complete will be identical to what is configured 
on the Arista devices (except I have dropped the "username/password" section as 
I didn't want that checked into GitHub).
