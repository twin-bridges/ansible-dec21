5A. Create a Playbook that executes a task against the arista group. 

Using the "eos_command" module, execute "show ip arp" and register the output. 

Print this registered output to stdout.


5B. Add an additional set of tasks to use eos_command to execute "show ip arp | json". 

Once again register this output and print it to standard output. 

For the "show ip arp | json" output is a string returned or is structured data
