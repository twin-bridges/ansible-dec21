Create a Playbook that clears the logging buffer on the cisco6 device. The 
command to clear the logging buffer is: "clear logging". 

This command will prompt for confirmation ("Clear logging buffer [confirm]"). 

Ensure that your task handles the confirmation appropriately. 

Register and print the results of the task to stdout. 

Remember that "prompt" takes a regular expression so you either need to simplify 
it or backslash escape special regex characters (I strongly recommend you 
simplify your pattern to avoid regular expression characters, if possible).
