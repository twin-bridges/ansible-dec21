Use the nxos_l3_interfaces resource module to configure an IP address on 
Ethernet1/4 on both NX-OS switches. 

The interface name (Ethernet1/4), the IP address, and the netmask should be 
stored in host_vars. You should be using the "merged" state for this operation. 

If "Ethernet1/4" is being used by another student, then you can use either 
"Ethernet1/3" or "Ethernet1/2". 

For the IP network, choose a random /24 network from the 10.227.X.X range. 
Use 10.227.X.1 for nxos1 and 10.227.X.2 for nxos2.

After configuring the interfaces, use the net_ping module to verify IP connectivity 
between the two NX-OS switches. 

Use an assert statement(s) to verify the ping worked correctly (>=80% of the ping 
responses should be returned).
