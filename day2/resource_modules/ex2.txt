Use the eos_vlans resource module to create a VLAN and to assign the VLAN a name 
on all four of the Arista switches. The VLAN ID should be in the VLAN range from 
VLAN 200 to 299.

After this VLAN is created, then use the eos_l2_interfaces resource module to assign 
that VLAN to one of the interfaces on all four of the Arista switches. You should 
either Ethernet5, Ethernet6, or Ethernet7 (do NOT use Ethernet1). 

Your VLAN ID, VLAN name, and interface name should be stored in either host_vars or 
group_vars.

Using eos_command and a show command(s), verify that your VLAN exists and that the 
Ethernet interface you chose was assigned to that interface (I used "show vlan | json"). 

This verification will probably require that you use an assert statements.
