Create an Ansible playbook that executes against all of the devices
in inventory. Set gather_facts to False.

Expand upon the group_vars and host_vars from exercise2. This time
add a host_vars variable for both cisco5 and cisco6 that sets the
bgp_asn to 33.

Create a task that prints the bgp_asn, but only if the bgp_asn value
is 33.
