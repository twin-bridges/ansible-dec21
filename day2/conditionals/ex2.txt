Create an Ansible playbook that executes against all of the devices
in inventory. Set gather_facts to False.

Create a group_vars variable that applies to all of the devices in the
arista group. This variable should be named "bgp_asn" and have a value of
"42".

Add a task using the debug module that prints out the value of this bgp_asn
variable. Note, you will need to control the logic of this task such that
the task will not execute for devices that do not have this bgp_asn variable.
