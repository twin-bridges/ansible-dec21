Copy the ~/ansible-hosts.ini file into a different folder. Remove the
ansible_ssh_pass from the all:vars section.

Create a playbook that connects to the two VMX routers. Use the junos_command
module to execute "show interface terse" on these two VMX devices.

Execute "ansible-playbook" and pass in the "-i ./ansible-hosts.ini" to use the 
local ansible-hosts.ini file (without the SSH password).

Also pass in the -k argument to ansible-playbook (to prompt for the SSH
password). Verify the playbook executes properly.
