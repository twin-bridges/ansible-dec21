Modify the special ansible-hosts.ini file such that the ansible_user
for the "cisco" group is named "test9". This test9 user is defined on the
"cisco1" router, but only connects with privilege level1.

Create an Ansible playbook that connects to "cisco1" using your special
ansible-hosts.ini file. Use the ios_command module to execute "show ip int brief".
This command should work properly since it does not require any elevated
privileges.

Create a second task that uses ios_command and attempts to execute "show run".
This command should fail (at this point) since we are still using privilege
level1. 

Reminder: you will still need to use the "-k" argument to ansible-playbook to
send the regular SSH password.

Now add the following two arguments at the "play" level:

  become: true
  become_method: enable

Expand your playbook to "register" the show run output and then print it out in
a subsequent "debug" task.

Re-execute your playbook and pass in both the "-k" and the "-K" arguments. Note,
the enable secret is the same as the standard lab SSH password.

Verify your playbook properly elevates priviles and displays the "show run"
output.
