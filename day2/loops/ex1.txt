Create a playbook that executes against localhost.

Using the "vars" keyword in a play define two lists of IP addresses.
List1 should be four IP addresses in San Francisco. List2 should be
four IP addresses in Dallas. Just make up IP addresses for each location.

Create a task that uses "debug" to print out all of the IP addresses for
the two lists. You should use a "loop" to accomplish this. 

Note, in Ansible you can concatenate two lists by doing:

"{{ list1 }} + {{ list2 }}"
