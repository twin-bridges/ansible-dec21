Create a playbook that executes against localhost.

Using the "vars" keyword in a play define a dictionary named "dallas_devices".
This dictionary should have three keys: rtr1, rtr2, rtr3. Each of the keys
should point to values that is another dictionary. This inner dictionary should
have two key-value pairs: ip_addr, and device_type (where ip_addr is some
random IP address and device_type is either "arista_eos" or "juniper_junos".

Create a task that uses "debug" and loops over this "dallas_devices" dictionary.
For each key in the outer dictionary, it should print out both the key and IP
address from the inner dictionary.
